# Programming Language Sandbox

A collection of experiments to try out new (to me) programming language concepts

## Languages

### Nano

- Dynamically typed
- Expression language
- Integers
- Booleans
- Let expressions
- Binary operations
- Lambdas
- Block expressions
- If/else expressions

### Typed Nano

- Everything from Nano, but statically typed

### NanoHM

- Everything from Typed Nano, but with Hindley-Milner type inference

### NanoRow

- NanoHM, but with records and row polymorphism

### NanoML

- NanoRow, but with variants and pattern matching
